# 🌐 Live Network Visualization Guide

## Overview

You now have **TWO live network visualization tools** that show real-time packet transmission and training progress!

---

## 🎨 Visualization Tools

### 1. **`visualize_live_network.py`** - Basic Live Monitor

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time network topology (server + clients)
- ✅ Animated packet transmission
  - Blue packets (M) = Model distribution
  - Green packets (U) = Update collection
- ✅ Training progress bars for each client (0-100%)
- ✅ Live accuracy and loss plots
- ✅ Phase indicators (IDLE, SEND, TRAIN, RECV, AGG)
- ✅ Status panel with metrics

**How to run:**
```powershell
python visualize_live_network.py
```

**What you'll see:**
- **Top Section:** Animated network with moving packets
- **Right Side:** Live accuracy and loss graphs
- **Bottom:** Status information

---

### 2. **`visualize_live_network_advanced.py`** - Advanced Monitor

**Additional Features:**
- ✅ Dark theme with glow effects
- ✅ Packet trails (visual path history)
- ✅ Network latency display (ms)
- ✅ Bandwidth usage graph
- ✅ Enhanced visual effects
- ✅ Save to GIF option

**How to run:**
```powershell
# Normal mode
python visualize_live_network_advanced.py

# Save to GIF
python visualize_live_network_advanced.py --save
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Simulation Mode** (Default)
When you run the visualization WITHOUT running training:
- Simulates a complete training cycle
- Shows all 5 phases in a loop:
  1. **[IDLE]** - Waiting (30 frames)
  2. **[SEND]** - Distributing model (25 frames) - Blue packets flow server → clients
  3. **[TRAIN]** - Local training (75 frames) - Clients show progress bars 0% → 100%
  4. **[RECV]** - Collecting updates (25 frames) - Green packets flow clients → server
  5. **[AGG]** - Aggregation (30 frames) - Server combines models
- Displays metrics from previous training run (if available)

### **Live Mode** (With Active Training)
When you run training in other terminals:
1. Start visualization: `python visualize_live_network.py`
2. In another terminal: `python server.py`
3. In more terminals: `python client.py` (with different CLIENT_IDs)

The visualization will:
- Update metrics every 0.5 seconds
- Show real training progress
- Display actual accuracy/loss as they improve
- Reflect true network traffic

## 📊 Understanding the Visualization

### **Network Topology:**
```
         [SERVER]
        /        \
       /          \
   [CLIENT 0]  [CLIENT 1]
```

- **Server (Red circle):** Central aggregator
- **Clients (Cyan→Green circles):** Edge devices
  - Color changes based on training progress
  - Green = training in progress
- **Dashed lines:** Network connections

### **Packets:**
- **Blue circles with 'M':** Model packets (server → clients)
- **Green circles with 'U':** Update packets (clients → server)
- Packets animate along the connection lines

### **Training Progress:**
- **Green bar above client:** Shows training completion (0-100%)
- **Percentage text:** Numeric progress indicator

### **Phase Indicator (Top banner):**
- Shows current activity and round number
- Changes color/text based on phase

### **Live Graphs (Right side):**
1. **Test Accuracy:** Green line going up (target: >95%)
2. **Test Loss:** Red line going down (target: <0.1)
3. **Bandwidth (Advanced):** Orange line showing network activity

### **Status Panel (Bottom):**
- Completed rounds
- Current accuracy & loss
- Total network traffic
- Active phase
- Number of clients

## 🎬 Phase Cycle Explanation

### Phase 1: DISTRIBUTING (📤)
**What happens:**
- Server sends global model to all clients
- Blue packets flow from server to clients
- Bandwidth: High (15-18 packets/s)
- Duration: ~5 seconds

### Phase 2: TRAINING (🔄)
**What happens:**
- Each client trains on local data
- Progress bars fill up 0% → 100%
- No packet transmission
- Bandwidth: Low (2-4 packets/s)
- Duration: ~15 seconds (longest phase)

### Phase 3: COLLECTING (📥)
**What happens:**
- Clients send trained models back to server
- Green packets flow from clients to server
- Bandwidth: High (12-15 packets/s)
- Duration: ~5 seconds

### Phase 4: AGGREGATING (⚡)
**What happens:**
- Server combines client models using FedAvg
- No packet transmission
- Bandwidth: Medium (5-7 packets/s)
- Duration: ~6 seconds

### Phase 5: IDLE (⏸️)
**What happens:**
- Between rounds
- No activity
- Bandwidth: Minimal (1 packet/s)
- Duration: ~6 seconds

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Larger screen:** Visualization looks best on 1920x1080 or higher
2. **Multiple monitors:** Run visualization on one, training on another
3. **During training:** Start visualization FIRST, then training
4. **Save recordings:** Use `--save` flag for presentations

### **Troubleshooting:**
- **Window doesn't open:** Check if matplotlib backend is installed
- **Emojis look weird:** Normal - we replaced them with text labels
- **No data shown:** Run training first to generate metrics files
- **Slow animation:** Close other applications, reduce interval

### **Customization:**
You can modify these in the code:
- `num_clients`: Change number of clients (default: 2)
- `interval`: Animation speed in ms (default: 50)
- Colors, sizes, positions in the code

---

## 📁 Files Used by Visualization

The visualization reads these files:
- `training_history.json` - Accuracy, loss, rounds
- `performance_metrics.json` - Network traffic, durations

These are auto-generated during training.

---

## 🎓 For Academic Presentations

### **Demo Script:**
1. Open visualization first
2. Let audience see the simulation cycle
3. Explain each phase as it happens
4. Show the packets moving
5. Point out progress bars during training
6. Highlight accuracy improving on graphs

### **Best Angles:**
- "Watch how the model distributes to clients..."
- "See the clients training independently..."
- "Notice how updates flow back to the server..."
- "The server aggregates using FedAvg algorithm..."

### **Save for Slides:**
```powershell
# Record 20 seconds of animation
python visualize_live_network_advanced.py --save
```
Then insert `federated_learning_network.gif` into PowerPoint!

## 🚀 Example Session

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start visualization
python visualize_live_network.py

# Terminal 2: Start server (in project folder)
$env:SERVER_HOST="127.0.0.1"; python server.py

# Terminal 3: Start client 0
$env:CLIENT_ID="0"; python client.py

# Terminal 4: Start client 1  
$env:CLIENT_ID="1"; python client.py
```
